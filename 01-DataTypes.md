# Introduction to Data Types - April 18, 2020

Hi everyone! As you are going through the Python 
courses on edX, you have already been working with 
some of the most useful **data types** in Python, 
including _integers_, _floats_, and _strings_. Data 
types are a core component of any programming 
language, allowing you to store and manipulate many 
different kinds of data, like numbers, words, and 
lists. Here, we'll discuss how data types are 
implemented in Python and provide a reference for 
some of the most useful data types for biological 
data analysis.


## How do data types work in Python?

At first, the existence of different data types in 
Python may not be obvious. In many other programming 
languages, such as C++, data types are _explicitly_ 
defined when you declare a variable. For example, if 
I want to make a new variable `num` to hold the 
number 5, I would write

```c++
int num = 5;
```
