# Preamble - April 1, 2020

Hi everyone!  While you are beginning the linked courses on edX, we wanted to
introduce you to some of the concepts and utilities that you will need to get
you started in analyzing biological data.  Here, we'll introduce the **terminal**,
as well as programming languages like **Python**, and talk about how all these things
fit together for data analysis.  Mastering both the terminal and a programming
language like Python together will give you the power to ask and answer any
question that your data is capable of answering.

## What is the terminal?
Today, everyone interacts with their computer using a _graphical user interface_,
maneuvering through apps using a mouse or a trackpad to point and click.  For
example, when you scroll through a webpage or make a PowerPoint presentation,
you are engaging with the software graphically, clicking on links or dragging
figures around the screen.

However, another way to interact with the computer is through the _terminal_, or
_command line_.  Here's an example of what that looks like:

Through text commands, the terminal allows you to navigate your files, write code,
and run software, both on your computer and on external computing resources, like
HiPerGator.

## How can I get to the terminal?
This will depend on which operating system your computer is running:
  - **Windows:**
  - **Mac:** Macs are natively based on a UNIX computing environment, so this is far more straightforward.  Just open up the `Terminal` app from the Launchpad (may be tucked away in the `Other` category).  If you want to get fancy, feel free to install other terminal apps such as `iTerm2` or `hyper`, which offer some extra features like tabs and customization.

## What is a programming language?
Within the terminal, you'll be running software or executing code that you or others have written to perform some task, like aligning sequencing reads to the genome or counting splicing isoforms from RNA-seq.  All software or code is written in a _programming language_, which is a set of words and rules that, when strung together, allow a person to write programs that computers can run.  There are many programming languages to choose from, including older languages like `C++`

Programming languages can be divided up into essentially two types:
  1. **Compiled languages:**
  2. **Scripting languages:**
