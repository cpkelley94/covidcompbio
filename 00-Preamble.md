# Preamble - April 1, 2020

Hi everyone!  While you are beginning the linked courses on edX, we wanted to
introduce you to some of the concepts and utilities that you will need to get
you started in analyzing biological data.  Here, we'll introduce the **terminal**,
as well as programming languages like **Python**, and talk about how all these things
fit together for data analysis.  Mastering both the terminal and a programming
language like Python together will give you the power to ask and answer any
question that your data is capable of answering.

## What is the terminal?
Today, everyone interacts with their computer using a _graphical user interface_,
maneuvering through apps using a mouse or a trackpad to point and click.  For
example, when you scroll through a webpage or make a PowerPoint presentation,
you are engaging with the software graphically, clicking on links or dragging
figures around the screen.

## How can I get to the terminal?
This will depend on which operating system your computer is running:
  - **Mac:** Macs are natively based on a UNIX computing environment, so this is far more straightforward.  Just open up the `Terminal` app from the Launchpad (may be tucked away in the `Other` category).

## What is a programming language?

## Why are we using Python?

## How can we run Python code?
